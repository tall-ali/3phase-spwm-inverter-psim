# PSIM Simulation Environment Notes

This project reproduces and analyzes a three-phase Sinusoidal PWM inverter in PSIM, adapted for aerospace power applications.  
The setup and configuration details are provided below to ensure full reproducibility.


## Software Environment
- PSIM Demo Version 11.1.3.2.232  
- Copyright © 2001–2018 Powersim Inc.  
- Support: support@powersimtech.com  
- Website: http://www.powersimtech.com  


## Operating Environment
- OS: Linux Mint XFCE Edition  
- Compatibility Layer: Wine (Stable version)  
- PSIM executed via Wine environment for simulation and waveform export.  
- Verified stable operation and module access under Wine, with minor GUI lag during waveform rendering.



## Active Modules
- Motor Drive Module  
- Digital Control Module  
- SimCoupler Module  
- Thermal Module  
- Renewable Energy Module  
- PsimBook  

## Active Products
- SmartCtrl  


## Simulation Notes
- Initial warning observed: *“Maximum number of data points for demo is 600; data have been truncated.”*  
- Solved by reducing simulation duration to **0.02 s**, maintaining waveform integrity.  
- Circuit verified for **balanced 120° phase displacement** between outputs.  
- Generated output waveform exported as `docs/waveform.png`.  


## Adaptation Notes
Although the circuit base followed a public tutorial, this simulation was reinterpreted for **aircraft-grade inverter behavior**, focusing on:
- clean SPWM modulation for **aerospace power systems**  
- energy-efficient waveform control for **electric propulsion concepts**  
- reproducible structure for further **research in avionics and defense power converters**
